**Technical Approach & Design Decisions** (200 words)

This Visual Product Matcher leverages Next.js 15's App Router for optimal performance and SEO. The architecture separates concerns with dedicated components for image upload, product display, and filtering. TypeScript ensures type safety across the application.

The similarity engine uses a mock ML approach that simulates real-world computer vision APIs. Products are scored using randomized algorithms that consider category relevance and visual characteristics. This modular design allows easy integration with actual ML services like Google Vision API or custom TensorFlow.js models.

The UI prioritizes user experience with dual input methods (file upload and URL), real-time feedback, and comprehensive loading states. Tailwind CSS provides consistent, responsive styling optimized for mobile devices. The sticky sidebar ensures filters remain accessible while browsing results.

Error handling is implemented at multiple levels: component-level validation, API error responses, and a global error boundary. The product database uses structured TypeScript interfaces for maintainability and includes realistic product data across diverse categories.

Performance optimizations include Next.js Image optimization, lazy loading, and efficient state management. The application structure supports easy scaling with additional features like user accounts, advanced ML integration, and e-commerce functionality.
